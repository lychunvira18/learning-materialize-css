    - Added a photos using `grids` for responsiveness
    - `offset-[type]` to offset content by grid
    - `push-[type]` to push content to the right
    - `pull-[type]` to pull content to the left
    - `responsive-img` to make the image responsive
    - `materialboxed` to make the images zoom when clicked (IT'S SUPER COOL!!!)
